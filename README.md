Hi ! I'm Th√©ophile "fkS124" Aumont. I'm a french student.
I'm currently in game dev with Unity and Pygame.
I also love algorithmic and math.

# Experience

#### Programming languages
- Python : since 2019
- C : since 2022
- C++ : since 2022

#### Game dev engines/frameworks
- Pygame : since 2019

#### Remarkable projects
- [John's Adventure](https://github.com/mariospapaz/JohnsAdventure) : I am the main contributor to this project (the owner and leader of the project is [mariospapaz](https://github.com/mariospapaz))
- [Bad Burger](https://github.com/fkS124/Bad-Burger) : Game made for a the PyGameCommunity Summer Team Jam 2021 (with [mariospapaz](https://github.com/mariospapaz) and [Emc235](https://github.com/Emc2356))
- [Chess game](https://github.com/thegordonbeeman/py-chess) : A simple chess game, made with PyGame in collaboaration with [thegordonbeeman](https://github.com/thegordonbeeman) and [ozher](https://github.com/OZHER). We will release later this month (year ?) an AI to play against the computer.
- [Pygame Framework](https://github.com/fkS124/Pygame-Engine) : A framework I'm currently making, to create game with pygame, faster. It includes several GUI tools such as a map editor, or a tile set editor. For now, it supports only 2D games, but it seems expandable to top-down game in the future. I'm still working on it, and the goal is then to create a full 2D-rpg game using this engine when it'll be in a quite advanced state.
- [Arduino Projects](https://github.com/fkS124/Arduino-Projects) : Just a repo to store my programs using Arduino.
- [Hexagonal game of life](https://github.com/fkS124/game-of-life-remastered) : the Conway's game of life, but with hexagons instead of squares (made with [ozher](https://github.com/OZHER))
- [Matrix computation](https://github.com/fkS124/matrices) : matrices computation using C++. (still WIP)
