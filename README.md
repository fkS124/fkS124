Hi ! I'm Th√©ophile "fkS124" Aumont. I'm a french student.

I'm into gamedev using python, and science in general, especially Physics and Maths (see my simulations made in C and C++)

# Experience

#### Programming languages
- Python : since 2019
- C : since early 2022
- C++ : since early 2022

#### Game dev engines/frameworks
- Pygame : since 2019

#### Remarkable projects

* Physics
  - [2D Fluid Simulation](https://github.com/fkS124/2D-fluid-simulation) : simulated an incompressible fluid, using C and SDL2.

* Maths
  - [Hexagonal game of life](https://github.com/fkS124/game-of-life-remastered) : the Conway's game of life, but with hexagons instead of squares (made with [ozher](https://github.com/OZHER))
  - [Matrix computation](https://github.com/fkS124/matrices) : matrices computation using C++.

* Game dev
  - [John's Adventure](https://github.com/mariospapaz/JohnsAdventure) : I am the main contributor to this project (the owner and leader of the project is [mariospapaz](https://github.com/mariospapaz))
  - [Bad Burger](https://github.com/fkS124/Bad-Burger) : Game made for a the PyGameCommunity Summer Team Jam 2021 (with [mariospapaz](https://github.com/mariospapaz) and [Emc235](https://github.com/Emc2356))
  - [Chess game](https://github.com/thegordonbeeman/py-chess) : A simple chess game, made with PyGame in collaboaration with [thegordonbeeman](https://github.com/thegordonbeeman) and [ozher](https://github.com/OZHER). We will release later this month (year ?) an AI to play against the computer.
  - [Cube's hidden dimensions](https://fks124.itch.io/cubes-hidden-dimensions) : A 2.5D platformer, where you control a cube travelling through plenty of dimensions, each of them hiding a secret... Made with [ozher](https://github.com/OZHER). In a nutshell, we built a perspective-based 3d engine, which transform a 2d scene into a 2.5d scene, showing perspectives.

* Others
  - [Arduino Projects](https://github.com/fkS124/Arduino-Projects) : Just a repo to store my programs using Arduino.
